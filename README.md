This project is an experiment, created as a general purpose shell to dynamically load external widgets.  The intent is to document the pain-points and discover possible solutions for specific design patterns while learning and leveraging best practices from Angular2's latest beta code release.

The initial boilerplate code was generated by utilizing *angular-cli*

> npm install -g angular-cli
